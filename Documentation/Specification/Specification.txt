% QuinCe Project Specification

# Introduction
The QuinCe project is a software system to designed to streamline the processing and quality control of data from continuous CO~2~ measurement instruments on board ships. The system will be developed as part of the Marine portion of the EU Integrated Carbon Observing System ([ICOS](http://www.icos-infrastructure.eu/)).

The project is initially intended for use by scientists taking part in the Marine portion of the ICOS project, and will focus primarily on their requirements and those of ICOS itself. However, the long term aim is to provide its services to the global surface ocean CO~2~ community in the future, and perhaps provide an example to develop similar systems for automated data collection efforts in other fields.

# Project Features
The aim of the QuinCe project is to provide an online, automated system that will process raw data from ship-board CO~2~ measuring equipment. The processing will consist of the following:

* Data reduction
* Automatic Level One quality control
* Data viewing
* Assignment of WOCE QC flags
* Data export
* Submission to the ICOS [Carbon Portal](https://www.icos-cp.eu/).

## Data Reduction
Data reduction is the process of converting calculating the partial pressure and/or fugacity of carbon dioxide (pCO~2~ or fCO~2~) from the raw instrument data. These calculations must take into account the calibration of individual sensors and also adjust the results in relation to the instruments' measurements taken from known gas standards.

Data reduction is currently performed by the scientists running their own instruments. While all scientists will perform their calculations based on practices described in the scientific literature, there will inevitably be slight differences between them through the use of different methods and different interpretations of those methods. This document will specify the data reduction method to be used by the QuinCe system, as agreed in discussion with the scientific community.

## Automatic Level One Quality Control
Once the data reduction has been completed, a set of automatic quality control routines will examine the data, looking for anomalies that indicate likely problems. These will include, but not be limited to:

* Missing data
* Values outside a reasonable ranges
* Detection of outliers
* Excessive variability in the data

The quality control routines will be written as individual modules, so more can be added as they are developed. This document will specify the framework for the modular system, but not the workings of any individual quality control modules. Those will be described in separate documentation.

## Data Viewing
The QuinCe system will allow users to view the contents of their data files on maps, plots, and in tabular form. Results from the data reduction and quality control stages will also be visible, allowing the user to examine them within the system.

## Assignment of WOCE QC Flags
The user will be able to assign WOCE QC flags and sub-flags (which indicate the item(s) that led to the assignment of the main flag) to the individual records in a data file. These flags can be used to remove bad records from the data or to indicate the quality of the data to future users after publication.

## Data Export
The QuinCe system will add extra information to the uploaded data files as it performs data reduction and quality control, along with the WOCE flags set by the user. The system will allow the user to export their data, along with these additions, in a variety of formats. The most basic export options will be:

* The original data file, with extra columns added.
* A cut-down version of the file, containing only the original data used in the data reduction steps and extra columns added.

In addition, the system will allow users to export data in a variety of formats for submissions to other systems, e.g. [SOCAT](http://www.socat.info).

## Submission to the ICOS Carbon Portal
All data collected under the umbrella of the ICOS project will need to be published through the [ICOS Carbon Portal](https://www.icos-cp.eu/). The QuinCe system will provide a method for users to submit data to this portal directly, reformatting the data as required.

# Defining Instrument Details

## Naming Instruments
QuinCe will identify each instrument that it knows about by a single string that contains a name, which must be unique across all known instruments. Typically this will contain the name of the ship on which the instrument is installed. However, it is possible that more than one instrument may be installed on the same ship, or multiple ships have the same name. In this case, further identifying features (e.g. instrument name or ship call sign) will be required. The choice of instrument name will be left to the individual user.

## Instrument Parameters
Each instrument must provide a minimum set of measured parameters. These are in three broad categories.

### Location and Time
Each measurement must be located in space and time, and these values must be part of the instrument's output. Positional data must be provided as latitude and longitude, usually as decimal degrees, although other formats (e.g. degrees and decimal minutes, or degrees, minutes and seconds) can be supported. The date and time of the measurement must be provided to an accuracy of one second. Again, multiple formats of dates will be supported.

### Measurement types

In many cases, not all measurements reported in the data files are of sea water CO~2~. It is usual practice to intersperse periods of surface CO~2~ measurements with measurements from a set of gas standards, to allow for calibration of the instrumentation [e.g. _Pierrot et al. 2009_]. QuinCe must be able to identify which records from data files correspond to sea water measurements, and which to gas standards of different concentrations. This will allow the system to automatically calibrate the sea water measurements against the gas standards, and also to process the gas standard measurements separately from the sea water measurements during quality control.

There are periods when measurements from an instrument cannot be trusted. For example, when switching between sea water measurements and gas standard measurements, there is usually a period during which the gas lines contain residual gases from a previous set of measurements [_Pierrot et al. 2009_]. During this time, it is likely that measurements are still being recorded by the instrument, and these should be ignored as they will be unreliable. The user will be asked to specify the length of time for which such measurements should be ignored.

### Sensor Parameters
QuinCe will require data from sensors measuring the following parameters in order to perform the data reduction calculations:

* Sea surface temperature
* Sea level pressure
* Sea surface salinity
* Equilibrator temperature
* Equilibrator pressure

QuinCe will require at least one sensor from each category to be defined, although any number of sensors can be present for each category. For example, in large equilibrators, two temperature sensors are sometimes installed to measure the top and bottom. Where more than one sensor of a given type is present, the mean of all measured values will be used in calculations performed by QuinCe. This will be described in detail later in the document.

For each sensor, the user must specify the units in which its output is recorded in the data files. For example, some temperature sensors report degrees Celsius directly, while some report their measurements in millivolts (mV). The conversion between mV and °C is combined with the calibration coefficients for the sensor; QuinCe will ask for this information whenever a data file is uploaded.

## Data file specification
Each instrument will produce a data file whose format is likely to be unique. The user must therefore tell QuinCe which columns contain which data. The user need only specify the columns required for data reduction (i.e. the required sensors, measured CO~2~ and moisture), the ship's position, and the time of the measurement. Any other columns in the data files will be ignored.

One of the columns in the data file must specify the type of each measurement: either sea water or a gas standard. The user must specify which column contains this information, and which values indicate sea water measurements or gas standard measurements of specific concentrations.

If there is a column in the data file that indicates whether or not a given measurement should be ignored, then this must also be specified, along with which value(s) indicate measurements to be used and those to be discarded.

# Uploading data files
Once an instrument and its corresponding data format have been defined, the user will be able to upload data files for analysis. Each file will be uniquely identified by its filename and the name of the instrument from which it was produced. If a file of the same name already exists, the user will be asked to choose what to do with it:

* Replace the existing file of the same name and restart analysis from the beginning (all previous analysis will be lost).
* Give the file a different name and treat it as a brand new file.
* Abort the attempt to upload the file.

Once the file has been uploaded, it will be put through the data reduction and quality control routines as described below.

## Entry of calibration/conversion coefficients

Each time a file is uploaded, the user will be asked to provide the necessary parameters to convert and correct the output of each sensor. Where the sensor records values in the units required by QuniCe (e.g. °C for temperature), the user must supply the calibration coefficients to adjust the value reported by the sensor to the true value. Where the sensor reports a 'raw' value (e.g. mV), the user will be asked for the conversion coefficients to allow QuinCe to calculate the required value. QuinCe will assume that the conversion coefficients implicitly include any calibration adjustments required.

## Removal of data files
QuinCe will not keep copies of uploaded data files indefinitely; they will only exist on the system for as long as they are being analysed. Users will be encouraged to delete their files once the analysis is complete and they have exported all the results they need. If a file is left untouched for 60 days, the file and any related analysis will be automatically deleted. The user will be given appropriate warnings before this happens.

# Data Reduction

Once a data file has been uploaded, QuinCe will automatically perform data reduction routines to calculate pCO~2~. Where multiple sensors are specified for a given parameter in the calculations, the mean of those sensors will be used.

## Calculation of fCO~2~

The method used to calculate fCO~2~ will follow that of Pierrot et al. [_2009_].

The gas taken from the equilibrator is dried before being measured $\left(\left(x\!C\!O_2\right)_{T_e}^d\right)$. In many cases the mechanical drying does not completely remove the moisture, so the measured gas must be 'mathematically' dried:

$\left(x\!C\!O_2\right)_{T_e}^d = \frac{\left(x\!C\!O_2\right)_{T_e}^{r\!a\!w}}{\frac{1 - M}{1000}}$

where $\left(x\!C\!O_2\right)_{T_e}^{r\!a\!w}$ and $M$ are the CO~2~ and moisture measured in the gas analyser respectively.

The air in the equilibrator is assumed to be at 100% humidity. The CO~2~ must therefore be adjusted to account for the increase in CO~2~ concentration resulting from the drying process:

$\left(p\!C\!O_2\right)_{T_e}^w = \left(x\!C\!O_2\right)_{T_e}^d \left(P_e - p\!H_2O\right)$

where $T_e$ is the equilibrator temperature in degrees Kelvin, $P_e$ is the equilibrator pressure, and $p\!H_2O$ is the water vapour pressure over a sea water sample of a given salinity at equilibrator tin emperature $T_e$ and salinity $S$. $w$ and $d$ indicate wet and dry gas respectively. $p\!H_2O$ is calculated as:

$p\!H_2O = \exp\left[24.4543 - 67.4509\left(\frac{100}{T_{e}}\right) - 4.8489  \ln\left(\frac{T_{e}}{100}\right) - 0.000544S \right]$

The fugacity of CO~2~ in the sea water is then calculated as:

$\left(f\!C\!O_2\right)_{T_e}^w = \left(p\!C\!O_2\right)_{T_e}^w \exp\left(\frac{\left[B + 2\left(1 - \left(xC\!O_2\right)_{T_e}^w\right)^2 \delta\right]P_{a\!t\!m}}{RT_e}\right)$

where:

$B = -1636.75 + 12.0408T_e - 3.27957\times10^{-2}T_e^2 + 3.16528\times10^{-5}T_e^3$

and:

$\delta = 57.7 - 0.118T_e$

and:

$R = 82.0578$

Finally, fCO~2~ at sea water temperature is calculated using the empirical formulation of Takahashi et al. [_1993_]:

$\left(f\!C\!O_2\right)_{S\!S\!T}^w = \left(f\!C\!O_2\right)_{T_e}^w \exp\left[0.0423 \left( S\!S\!T - T_e\right)\right]$

## Standards calibration

Each instrument will periodically measure CO~2~ and moisture from a set of gas standards (three or above). QuinCe will read the measurements from these standards and use them to calibrate the values reported by the gas analyser. It will adjust the the CO~2~ measured from the sea water accordingly.

### Switching between gas standards and sea water measurements

As described previously, each time the instrument switches between gas standards and/or sea water measurements, there will be a period of time where the measurements should be ignored until all residual gas from the previous set of measurements has been removed. QuinCe will therefore ignore any measurements for the period of time specified when the instrument's details were entered by the user (see above).

### Applying the standards calibrations

The standards calibrations for both CO~2~ and moisture are applied using the same method. Here, the application of CO~2~ calibrations to the measured sea water CO~2~ is described, and visualised in Fig. 1.

Each gas standard is measured periodically, and the measured CO~2~ recorded in the output file as with any other measurement (left, coloured circles). Between each standard's measurement, the gas standard values are interpolated linearly (dashed lines). When a sea water measurement is taken (black cross), the differences between the gas standards at that time (using the interpolated standards measurements) are calculated (vertical line). The measured gas standard values are plotted against the actual concentrations in the standard gas (right, black circles), and a linear fit made to the points to establish the relationship between the gas concentrations measured by the gas analyser and the true concentrations. The sea water measurement is placed on this line (red plus sign) to calculate the true concentration from that measured. In the example shown, the measured concentration is 428.41ppm, which converts to a true value of 443.68ppm. During the data reduction, it is this calculated true value (for both CO~2~ and moisture) that is used.

(Left) the measurements from the gas analyser (filled circles) are compared to the known standard gas concentrations (horizontal dotted lines) at various times. The differences are interpolated linearly between standards measurements. A measurement is taken at 13:20 (black X and vertical line). (Right) The measurements and known standards are compared at 13:20 using the interpolated values between standard measurements (circles and diagonal line), and a linear fit applied. The measurement (red X; 428.41ppm) is placed on the fitted line to establish the true CO~2~ concentration (443.68ppm).](standard_series.png)
