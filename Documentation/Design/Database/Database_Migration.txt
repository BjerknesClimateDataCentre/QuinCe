# Database migration scripts

Database migration scripts are handled by the flywayMigration library provided
by boxfuse, https://flywaydb.org/

Flyway functionality is enabled using the flyway plgin for gradle. Database
migration scripts are added to the folder

* src/migrations/flywayMigrations/dbmigrations

where the migration scripts are sql files named after the following convention:

* V[number]__[any_name].sql

An example file could be eg: V2__github_issue_740.sql
...referencing github issue #740 for the QuinCe project.

Database schema versions is simply a running number starting on one for the
database baseline, so start you script on the lowest available number. Migration
scripts not applied will be run on the next migration.

Migration scripts for the test server are applied daily after resetting the
database to the state of the production database.

For the production server, migration scripts that have not yet run, will be
applied on the next release.
